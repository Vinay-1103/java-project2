# ☕ Coffee Ordering System – Java Project

A simple Java-based Coffee Ordering System designed for a restaurant environment. This console-based application allows users to select coffee items, view the menu, and calculate the total bill. It showcases object-oriented programming concepts like **interfaces**, **classes**, and **method overriding**.

---

## 🧾 Project Overview

The Coffee Ordering System simulates a basic point-of-sale (POS) system for a coffee shop. Users can:
- View a menu of available coffee options
- Select items and quantities
- Calculate the total amount
- Exit or restart the order process

This project is ideal for beginners learning **interfaces**, **constructors**, and **Java logic structuring**.
